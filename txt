Make the head

Everything in our HTML file will go between the opening <html> and closing </html> tags.

There are always two parts to an HTML file: the head and the body.
Let's start with the head.

The head contains information about your HTML file, like its title.
The title is what we see in the browser's title bar or page tab. 
For example the title of this page is "HTML Basics | Codecademy".

Instructions

Let's add a head and a title to our webpage.
